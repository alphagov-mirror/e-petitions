Dear <%= @signature.name %>,

You recently signed the <%= "petition".pluralize(@count) %>:

<% @petitions.each do |petition| %>
<%= petition.action %>
<%= petition_url(petition) %>

<% end %>
<% if @remaining > 0 %>
Plus another <%= pluralize(@remaining, "petition", locale: :en) %>

<% end %>
Because of the General Election, the closing date for the <%= "petition".pluralize(@count) %> you signed has changed. All petitions now have to close at <%= @closing_time %> on <%= @closing_date %>. This is because Parliament will be dissolved, which means all parliamentary business – including petitions – will come to an end until after the election. This means the petitions site will be closed and people will not be able to start or sign petitions.

We’re sorry we weren’t able to give you more notice that this would happen.

The <%= "petition".pluralize(@count) %> will be available for people to read on the site even though it will be closed for signatures. <%= @count > 1 ? "These petitions" : "This petition" %> won’t be reopened after the election.

The Government can’t respond to petitions during the election period. This means if <%= @count > 1 ? "any of the petitions" : "the petition" %> has over <%= Site.formatted_threshold_for_response %> signatures, <%= @count > 1 ? "they" : "it" %> can’t receive a response from the current Government after <%= @last_response_date %>. After the election, the new Government will have to decide whether it wants to respond to petitions from before the election.

The Petitions Committee, the group of MPs who decide whether petitions are debated, won’t exist after <%= @closing_date %>. This means that if <%= @count > 1 ? "any of the petitions" : "the petition" %> has over <%= Site.formatted_threshold_for_debate %> signatures, <%= @count > 1 ? "they" : "it" %> can’t be scheduled for debate during this Parliament. After the election, there will be a new Petitions Committee, and they will be responsible for deciding which petitions are debated.

The petitions site will open again after the election, but at the moment we don’t know exactly when. You can follow us on Twitter @HoCPetitions for updates, or check back on the petitions site for news if you prefer.

Ahead of the General Election on <%= @election_date %>, make sure you’re registered to vote. You can check whether you’re eligible to vote and find out how to register at: https://www.gov.uk/register-to-vote. The deadline to register to vote is <%= @registration_deadline %>.</p>

Many thanks,
